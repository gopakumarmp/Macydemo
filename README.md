Demo for Macy
1: I have used the UICollectionView Controller to implement the main view of the Macy App. UI Collection View can aptly represent the complex view that the Macy app has. I have implemented the following protocols  for handling the events in the front view, I could not finish the search delegates due to lack of  time (UICollectionViewDataSource,UICollectionViewDelegate,UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout) .The layout needs to be more fine tuned. First view was created using storyboard and other view using .xib file.

2: Once you tap on any of the cells I am just launching a UIViewController and presenting the Tap count, and then dismissing the present view as user presses done on that detail view. I created only one view as I was just going to show the tap count on the second view

3: Icons are just cropped from the existing screen that was attached with the assignment question, so please bear with the icon quality.
4: I have just tested this on the simulator.
